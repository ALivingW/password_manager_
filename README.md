# password_manager_
I have made a password manager project where users have their own accounts, and they can store can add passwords to them. User can login and signup, and when they do, their usernames and passwords are shown to them 

This projects adds to my last password manager project as i have now developed a front-end that users can use to see their passwords, and make changes to their account
